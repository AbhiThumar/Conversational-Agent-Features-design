# Conversational-Agent-(Siri)-Feature
We made some design for some additional features on the Conversational Agent which we use on our phone daily. The motive for making this was to make the life easy.

We have conducted a survey in our collage to gather the information about what features a user want and what he dislike/like the most in the Conversational Agent he/she uses. You can check the survey report file.

We have used  Siri to show the design for the newly added features we made.
